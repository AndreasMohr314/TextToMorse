# TextToMorse

**TextToMorse** is a non-commercial project developed solely for educational purposes and personal practice.

## Project Features

The project is accessible via GitHub Pages at [TextToMorse](https://andreasmohr314.github.io/TextToMorse/).  
It allows users to:

1. Convert any text (up to a maximum character limit) into Morse code and play it directly in the browser.
2. Download their text as a `.wav` file.

Everything is implemented using **vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

### Core Component: `waveFileCombiner.js`

The core of this project is the `waveFileCombiner.js`, which enables combining individual `.wav` files for letters and symbols at a binary level directly in the browser. This component is essential for creating seamless Morse code audio.
